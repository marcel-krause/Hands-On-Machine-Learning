# Hands-On Machine Learning

This repo provides my own code snippets from several chapters of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by [Aurélien Géron](https://github.com/ageron), mostly in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
